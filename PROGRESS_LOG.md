# ZeroPoint Portal Setup - Progress Log

This file documents the automated setup progress for the ZeroPoint Portal Docker image.

## 1. Project Initialization
- A setup script (`/home/x/setup_zeropoint.sh`) was created to generate the necessary project structure.
- The script was executed, creating the `zeropoint-portal` directory and populating it with the following files:
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `entrypoint.sh`
  - `supervisord.conf`
  - `Caddyfile`
  - `otel-collector.yaml`
  - `portal/index.html`
  - `openwebui-presets/hermes_prompts.json`
  - `openwebui-presets/hermes_presets.json`

## 2. Docker Image Build
- **Attempt 1:** The `docker build` command was initiated.
  - **Result:** Failed due to an incorrect directory context. The tool could not switch to the `zeropoint-portal` directory.
- **Attempt 2:** The `docker build` command was re-initiated using an absolute path to the build context (`/home/x/zeropoint-portal`).
  - **Result:** Failed with a permission error when trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket.
- **Attempt 3:** A `sudo docker build` command was prepared to resolve the permission error.
  - **Result:** The user cancelled this operation before it was executed.

## Next Step
- The next logical step is to execute the `sudo docker build` command to create the Docker image. The command is:
  `sudo docker build -t levelup2x/zeropoint-portal:cuda12.9 /home/x/zeropoint-portal`
