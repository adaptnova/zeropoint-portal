# Feature Specification: Secure, Hermetic Docker Image Factory

**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: In Progress

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer at AdaptNova, I want a centralized, secure, and automated system for building and managing Docker images, so that I can ship applications quickly and safely, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure or security vulnerabilities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new application with a Dockerfile, **When** I add it to the image factory, **Then** it is automatically built, tested, scanned, and signed.
2. **Given** a base image with a security vulnerability, **When** a patch is available, **Then** the base image is automatically rebuilt and all dependent application images are rebuilt and re-scanned.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a build fails?
- How are vulnerability scan results handled?
- How are secrets managed during the build process?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a standardized, convention-based repository structure for managing Docker images.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST use curated, digest-pinned "golden" base images.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST enforce security best practices, such as non-root users and minimal privileges.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST automate the build, test, and scan process for all images.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST generate SBOMs and provenance attestations for all images.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST sign all production-ready images.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide clear documentation for developers.

### Key Entities
- **Golden Base Image**: A minimal, secure, and curated base image for a specific stack (e.g., CUDA, Python).
- **Application Image**: An image for a specific application, built on top of a golden base image.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: The automated workflow for building, testing, and deploying images.
